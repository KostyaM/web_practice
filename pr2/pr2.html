                    Kotlin is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose programming language with type
                    inference. Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and the JVM version of Kotlin's
                    standard library depends on the Java Class Library,[3] but type inference allows its syntax to be
                    more concise. Kotlin mainly targets the JVM, but also compiles to JavaScript (e.g., for frontend web
                    applications using React[4]) or native code (via LLVM); e.g., for native iOS apps sharing business
                    logic with Android apps.[5] Language development costs are borne by JetBrains, while the Kotlin
                    Foundation protects the Kotlin trademark.

                Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few
                implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let
                application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[17] meaning that compiled Java code can run on
                all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.[18] Java applications are typically
                compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying
                computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities
                than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code
                modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was
                one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub,[19][20] particularly for
                client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers

                    C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C
                    programming language, or "C with Classes". The language has expanded significantly over time, and
                    modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for
                    low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many
                    vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel,
                    Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on many platforms

                Lisp (historically LISP) is a family of programming languages with a long history and a distinctive,

                high-level programming language in widespread use today. Only Fortran is older, by one year.[4][5] Lisp
                has changed since its early days, and many dialects have existed over its history. Today, the best-known
                general-purpose Lisp dialects are Racket, Common Lisp, Scheme and Clojure.

                Ruby on Rails, or Rails, is a server-side web application framework written in Ruby under the MIT
                License. Rails is a model–view–controller (MVC) framework, providing default structures for a database,
                a web service, and web pages. It encourages and facilitates the use of web standards such as JSON or XML
                for data transfer and HTML, CSS and JavaScript for user interfacing. In addition to MVC, Rails
                emphasizes the use of other well-known software engineering patterns and paradigms, including convention
                over configuration (CoC), don't repeat yourself (DRY), and the active record pattern.

                    Swift is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm, compiled programming language developed by Apple Inc.
                    and the open-source community, first released in 2014. Swift was developed as a replacement for
                    Apple's earlier programming language Objective-C, as Objective-C had been largely unchanged since
                    the early 1980s and lacked modern language features. Swift works with Apple's Cocoa and Cocoa Touch
                    frameworks, and a key aspect of Swift's design was the ability to interoperate with the huge body of
                    existing Objective-C code developed for Apple products over the previous decades. It is built with
                    the open source LLVM compiler framework and has been included in Xcode since version 6, released in
                    2014. On Apple platforms,[11] it uses the Objective-C runtime library which allows C, Objective-C,
                    C++ and Swift code to run within one program.
